                <h1>Madara Uchiha</h1>
                <p>The world is full of things that don't go as you wish. The longer you live... the more you realize
                    that reality is just of pain,suffering and emptiness...<br>
                    In this world wherever there is light - there are also shadows. As long as the concept of winner
                    exits there also must be losers.<br> The selfish desire of want if to maintain peace causes wars and
                    hatred is born to protect love.<br>
                    Our life is short and temporary,we do not have much time in this world but it is how we utilize and
                    spend the time that is given to us that really matters.</p>

                <p>"When people get hurt, they learn to hate...When people hurt others. they become hated and racked with guilt. But knowing that pain allows people to be kind. Pain allows people to grow...and you grow is upto you.

                <h1>Pain</h1>
                <p>Humans are nothing but divided amongst the two sides of a coin. They would wanna fight for peace, but
                    by physical war, and only that victory would bring them the final peace.<br>
                    People cannot show each other their true feelings. Fear, suspicion, and resentment never subside.
                    This world is filled with hatred, agony, and sufferings. All of these are the result of dishonesty
                    and lies.
                    World, when we enter into it, seems all new and exciting but as we grow more and more and reach our
                    final phase of living, all we realize is that life is all about nothingness and will end someday.

                <h1>Obito</h1>
                <p>A real leader may let other step over his corpse, but he will never step over his comrades.
                    Loves give birth  to sacrifice, which bring hatred and lets you know pain. The moment people come to know love, they run the risk of carrying hate.
